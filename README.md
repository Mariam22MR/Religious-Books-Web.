## Project Objective:
the objective of the project is to provide a comprehensive and accurate understanding of religious book references and their importance in enriching religious knowledge and promoting a correct understanding of sacred texts.

## Techniques used:
HTML
CSS
JavaScript

## Challenges And Solutions:
1-Identifying Reliable Sources and Reliable References:
sources and sources that might be inaccurate or biased. To overcome this, I focused on using well-known and approved sources by religious scholars.
2- Organize and Present Information in a Seamless Manner:
I had difficulty arranging the information in a way that grabbed attention and provided a comprehensive idea, without overwhelming the audience with details. To solve this problem, I focused on using key points and gradually presenting information making the content easier to understand and structured presentation.
3-Limited Time to Prepare: 
I had limited time to prepare the presentation and assemble the sources, which required me to organize the time well. I developed a clear plan for the project and set a timetable for the research and preparation parts, so that I made sure that each step was completed on time.

## The Next Step To Project Development:
1-Expanding research and adding new references:
studying more religious books and reviewing new interpretations to enrich the content and provide a comprehensive view of the approved references.

2-Add visual and interactive elements:
adding infographics, mind maps, or explainer videos to make information more engaging and easy to understand.
